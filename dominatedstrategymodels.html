     	 <h1>Dominated Strategy Models/Iterative Eliminations</h1>

     	 <p><strong>A strategy is dominated by another strategy if all of its payoffs are lower than the corresponding payoffs of another strategy.<br>Such strategy will never be used in the presence of other strategy and hence can be eliminated.<br>By Iteratively eliminating such strategies we can find out the solution of the model.</strong></p>


     	 <p><strong><u>Example:</u><br>For Player, <u>A<sup>1</sup></u> strategy is dominated by <u>B<sup>1</sup></u> strategy, so it will not be used in the presence of <u>B<sup>1</sup></u> strategy. Hence eliminated.<br>Remaing game is as follows:-
